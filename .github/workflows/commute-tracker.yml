### Step 2: Enable Actions (If Needed)

After committing:

1. **Go to the "Actions" tab**
2. If you see a message like "Workflows aren't being run on this repository", click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
3. You should now see **"Commute Tracker"** listed on the left sidebar
4. Click on it
5. Now you'll see the **"Run workflow"** button (dropdown on the right)

---

### Step 3: Test It

1. **Click "Run workflow" dropdown**
2. **Click the green "Run workflow" button**
3. **Wait ~30 seconds**
4. **Refresh the page**
5. You should see a workflow run with a ✅ (success) or ❌ (failure)

## If You Still Don't See "Run Workflow"

This can happen if:

**Issue 1: `workflow_dispatch` is not in the workflow**
- Make sure the YAML I provided includes `workflow_dispatch:` under the `on:` section
- This enables manual triggering

**Issue 2: Actions are disabled**
- Go to Settings → Actions → General
- Make sure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
- Click Save

**Issue 3: The workflow file has a syntax error**
- After committing, go to Actions tab
- Look for any error messages about the workflow file
- YAML is **very sensitive to indentation** - make sure you copied it exactly

## Visual Guide

After creating `.github/workflows/commute-tracker.yml`, your Actions tab should look like:
```
Actions
├── All workflows
│   └── Commute Tracker ← Click this
│       └── [Run workflow ▼] ← This button appears here
